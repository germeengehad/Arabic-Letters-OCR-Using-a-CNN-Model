- This project aims to apply OCR to recognize Arabic letters using a CNN model trained on a collection of Arabic letter images. Additionally.

- In this project, I decided to start with data augmentation. I then created a new dataset by extracting only the Arabic letters, ignoring the numbers. This resulted in 28 classes, one for each Arabic letter. I separated the data into training and validation sets. Finally, I built a CNN model, trained it, and saved it in HDF5 format for download

# Data Set
- Traditional OCR algorithms and techniques assume weâ€™re working with a fixed font of some sort. In the early 1900s, that could have been the font used by microfilms.
In the 1970s, specialized fonts were explicitly developed for OCR algorithms, thereby making them more accurate. By the 2000s, we could use the fonts pre-installed on our computers to automatically generate training data and use these fonts to train our OCR models.
Each of these fonts had something in common:
i. They were engineered in some manner.
ii. There was a predictable and assumed space between each character (thereby making segmentation easier).
iii. The styles of the fonts were more conducive to OCR.
This Dataset Consist of Images of Arabic letters and numbers , but we will work on letters only

#  Data Augmentation And Data Preprossing
- Rescaling: Normalizes pixel values to the [0, 1] range.
- Rotation: Randomly rotates images by up to 10 degrees.
- Fill Mode: Fills in new pixels using the nearest pixel values.
- Featurewise Centering and Normalization: Normalizes images by centering them and scaling by standard deviation.
- Flipping: Randomly flips images vertically and horizontally.
- Shearing: Applies shear transformations with an intensity of 0.2.
- Zooming: Zooms in or out on images by 20%.
- Brightness Adjustment: Adjusts brightness to 40%-60% of the original.
- Validation Split: Reserves 30% of images for validation.

# Build Model
This code sets up a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify 29 Arabic letters. Here's a brief description:
- Set Random Seed: Ensures reproducibility by setting seeds for TensorFlow and NumPy.
- Model Architecture:
  - Input Layer: 32x32 RGB images.
  - Conv Layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 size, ReLU activation.
  - Max Pooling 1: 2x2 pooling.
  - Conv Layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 size, ReLU activation.
  - Max Pooling 2: 2x2 pooling.
  - Conv Layer 3: 64 filters, 3x3 size, ReLU activation.
  - Flatten Layer: Converts 2D feature maps to 1D vector.

  - Dense Layer 1: 64 neurons, ReLU activation.
  - Output Layer: 29 neurons (one per Arabic letter), softmax activation.
- Compile the Model:
  - Optimizer: Adam.
  - Loss Function: Sparse categorical cross-entropy.
  - Metrics: Accuracy.
- Summary: Displays the model's architecture and parameters.
